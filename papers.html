                                             <p>Titanium-based alloy products manufactured by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) have been widely used in biomedical applications, owing to their high biocompatibility, significantly good mechanical properties. In order to improve the Ti–6Al–4V SLM-fabricated part quality and help the manufacturing engineers choose optimal process parameters, an optimization methodology based on an artificial neural network was developed to relate four key process parameters (laser power, laser scanning speed, layer thickness, and hatch distance) and two target properties of a part fabricated by the SLM technique (density ratio and surface roughness). A supervised learning deep neural network based on the backpropagation algorithm was applied to optimize input parameters for a given set of quality part outputs. Several methods were utilized to solve undesired problems occurring during neural network training to increase the model accuracy. The model’s performance was proven with a value of R2 of 99% for both density ratio and surface roughness. A selection system was then built, allowing users to choose the optimal process parameters for fabricated products whose properties meet a specific user requirement. Experiments performed with the optimal process parameters recommended by the optimization system strongly confirmed its reliability by providing the ultimate part qualities nearly identical to those defined by the user with only about 0.9–4.4% of errors at the maximum. Finally, a graphical user interface was developed to facilitate the choice of the optimum process parameters for the desired density ratio and surface roughness.</p>

                                             <p>Typical computer-based parameter optimization and uncertainty quantification of the additive manufacturing process usually requires significant computational cost for performing high-fidelity heat transfer finite element (FE) models with different process settings. This work develops a simple surrogate model using a feedforward neural network (FFNN) for a fast and accurate prediction of the temperature evolutions and the melting pool sizes in a metal bulk sample (3D horizontal layers) manufactured by the DED process. Our surrogate model is trained using high-fidelity data obtained from the FE model, which was validated by experiments. The temperature evolutions and the melting pool sizes predicted by the FFNN model exhibit accuracy of 99% and 98%, respectively, compared with the FE model for unseen process settings in the studied range. Moreover, to evaluate the importance of the input features and explain the achieved accuracy of the FFNN model, a sensitivity analysis (SA) is carried out using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. The SA shows that the most critical enriched features impacting the predictive capability of the FFNN model are the vertical distance from the laser head position to the material point and the laser head position.</p>

                                             <p>In this paper, the effects of two key process parameters of the selective laser melting process, namely laser power and scanning speed, on the single-track morphologies and the bead characteristics, especially the depth-to-width D/W and height-to-width H/W ratios, were investigated using both experimental and Machine Learning (ML) approaches. A total of 840 single tracks were fabricated with several combinations of laser power and scanning speed levels. Surface morphologies of the single tracks and bead profiles were thoroughly investigated, providing a track-type map and the evolutions of the bead characteristics as a function of laser power and scanning speed. The results indicate neither severe balling nor keyholing effect for all combinations of laser power and scanning speed. Besides, simple relationships cannot accurately describe the evolutions of the D/W and H/W ratios as a function of laser power and scanning speed. Two Machine Learning-based regression models, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network, were chosen to estimate the D/W and H/W ratios using laser power and scanning speed. The Bayesian optimization algorithm was employed to optimize the model hyperparameter selection. Both Machine Learning-based models appear to be able to predict reasonably well the two aspect ratios, D/W and H/W, with an overall R2 value reaching about 90%, evaluated on the cross-validation dataset after a few seconds of training time, respectively.</p>

                                             <p>In this study, a data-driven deep learning model for fast and accurate prediction of temperature evolution and melting pool size of metallic additive manufacturing processes are developed. The study focuses on bulk experiments of the M4 high-speed steel material powder manufactured by Direct Energy Deposition. Under non-optimized process parameters, many deposited layers (above 30) generate large changes of microstructure through the sample depth caused by the high sensitivity of the cladding material on the thermal history. A 2D finite element analysis (FEA) of the bulk sample, validated in a previous study by experimental measurements, is able to achieve numerical data defining the temperature field evolution under different process settings. A Feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) approach is trained to reproduce the temperature fields generated from FEA. Hence, the trained FFNN is used to predict the history of the temperature fields for new process parameter sets not included in the initial dataset. Besides the input energy, nodal coordinates, and time, five additional features relating layer number, laser location, and distance from the laser to sampling point are considered to enhance prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the temperature evolution is predicted well by the FFNN with an accuracy of 99% within 12 seconds.</p>

                                             <p>In the last decade, machine learning is increasingly attracting researchers in several scientific areas and, in particular, in the additive manufacturing field. Meanwhile, this technique remains as a black box technique for many researchers. Indeed, it allows obtaining novel insights to overcome the limitation of classical methods, such as the finite element method, and to take into account multi-physical complex phenomena occurring during the manufacturing process. This work presents a comprehensive study for implementing a machine learning technique (artificial neural network) to predict the thermal field evolution during the direct energy deposition of 316L stainless steel and tungsten carbides. The framework consists of a finite element thermal model and a neural network. The influence of the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each layer was also investigated. The results showed that an architecture based on 3 or 4 hidden layers and the rectified linear unit as the activation function lead to obtaining a high fidelity prediction with an accuracy exceeding 99%. The impact of the chosen architecture on the model accuracy and CPU usage was also highlighted. The proposed framework can be used to predict the thermal field when simulating multi-layer deposition.</p>

                                             <p>In this paper, the effects of uncertainty in laser energy on temperature evolutions in the directed energy deposition (DED) process of M4 High-Speed Steel are quantified using a machine-learning (ML) based stochastic approach. An ML-based surrogate model is first constructed using the data obtained from a finite element (FE) model, which was validated against experiments. Then, the uncertainty of the laser energy is characterized using the probabilistic method and Monte-Carlo method is used to propagate uncertainty. The statistical description of the target temperature fields is computed from that of the laser energy using the ML surrogate model. The results indicate that the laser input energy uncertainties can lead to a potent variation of the temperature fields. Moreover, using the ML-based surrogate model instead of the FE model reduces the computational cost significantly in the Monte-Carlo simulation.</p>

                                             <p>Numerical simulations of the incremental sheet forming (ISF) process using the finite element method (FEM) provide essential information for designing parts in automotive industries. However, solving numerous high-complexity FEM models during the designing phase requires many resources, leading to an increase in the final product's cost. This study presents a feedforward neural network (FFNN) to predict the deformed shape of an AA1050 sheet subjected to an ISF process. FEM solutions obtained from various vertical step size (Δz) of the forming tool are used to train and validate the FFNN. The model is then used to predict the deformed shape demonstrating by the displacement in the forming depth direction. The norm of the relative errors between the FFNN solution and FEM solution at the last forming step is about 2%. The predictive results illustrate the feasibility and potential of using FFNN as an efficient surrogate model to replace the time-consuming FEM-based ISF process simulation.</p>

                                             <p>Among metallic additive manufacturing technologies, wire and arc-directed energy deposition (WADED) is recently adopted to manufacture large industrial components. In this process, controlling the temperature evolution is very important since it directly influences the quality of the deposited parts. Typically, the temperature history in WADED can be obtained through experiments and/or numerical simulations, which are generally time-consuming and expensive. In this research, we developed a robust surrogate model (SM) for predicting the temperature history in WADED based on the combination of machining learning (ML) and finite element (FE) simulation. The SM model was built to predict the temperature history in the WADED of single weld tracks. For this purpose, FE model was first developed and validated against experiments. This validated FE model is then used to generate the data to train the ML modes based on the feed-forward neural network (FFNN). The trained SM model can fast and accurately predict the temperature history in the cases which were not previously used for training with a very high accuracy of more than 99% and in a very short time with only 38 s (after being trained) as compared with 5 h for a FE model. The trained SM can be used for studies that require a large number of simulations such as uncertainty quantification or process optimization.</p>

A DL-based surrogate model is first constructed using the data obtained from a finite element (FE) model, which was validated against experiment. Then, sources of uncertainty are characterized by the probabilistic method and are propagated by the Monte-Carlo (MC) method. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis (SA) using the variance-based method is performed to identify the parameters inducing the most uncertainty to the melting pool depth. Using the DL-based surrogate model instead of solely FE model significantly reduces the computational time in the MC simulation. The results indicate that all sources of uncertainty contribute to a substantial variation on the final printed product quality. Moreover, we find that the laser power, the convection, the scanning speed, and the thermal conductivity contribute the most uncertainties on the melting pool depth based on the SA results. These findings can be used as insights for the process parameter optimization of the DED process.</p>

                                             <p>Uncertainties raised from process parameters, material properties, and environmental conditions significantly impact the quality of the printed parts in the directed energy deposition (DED) process. In this study, we perform the characterization, propagation, and sensitivity analysis of the uncertainties in the DED process using deep learning (DL)-based surrogate model to investigate the influence of the uncertain input parameters on the quality of the final printed product. A DL-based surrogate model is first constructed using the offline data obtained from a finite element (FE) model, which was validated against experiments. Sources of uncertainties are characterized using the probabilistic method and are propagated using the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. Moreover, we perform the sensitivity analysis (SA) to determine the most influential sources of uncertainty and two potential use cases based on uncertainty quantification results Owing to the fast execution time of the surrogate model, the MC simulation is significantly efficient in terms of computational resources as compared to the simulation that is solely based on the FE model. It is shown that the investigated sources of uncertainty contribute substantially to the inconsistency of the final product quality as they induce variations in temperature field, cooling rate at the liquidus point, and melting pool sizes. These quantities are also strongly dependent on the clad height. Based on the SA results, the laser power, the scanning speed, the heat convection, and the thermal conductivity induce the most uncertainties to the melting pool sizes. Two potential use cases are assessed to further demonstrate the usefulness of UQ results (i.e., uncertainty reduction). In general, these findings provide valuable insights for the process parameter optimization of the DED under uncertainty to improve the quality of the final printed parts.</p>

Second, a FFNN-SM was trained and validated using the data generated from thermal simulations with different heat input levels (Q). The results reveal that the developed FFNN-SM enables a accurate prediction of the temperature evolution with a global R2 value higher than 98% and within only 40s.</p>

                                             <p>This study presents a calibration method based on machine learning techniques to identify parameters of hardening law of aluminum alloy sheets in complex manufacturing processes. A V-shape test is designed to characterize material behavior during an incremental sheet forming (ISF) process. A series of virtual materials is first generated using three physical features observed in a standard uniaxial tensile test: initial yield stress, maximum uniform plastic strain, and yield-to-strength ratio. These virtual materials are then employed in simulating the designed V-shape tests to numerically collect the material responses, such as forming forces, displacements, or their combinations. Several feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are developed and trained to relate the collected material responses to the relevant virtual materials. Then, the trained FFNNs were used to estimate the flow curve of AA5052-H32 sheets up to a plastic strain value of 1.0 using the experimentally measured response from the V-shape test during ISF. The FFNN-based flow curves appear to capture well the stress–strain data obtained from the uniaxial tensile test with the coefficients of determination up to 0.98. The identified flow curves are also employed to simulate the uniaxial tensile and ISF truncated cone tests. The simulated uniaxial tensile forces are in good agreement with the experimentally measured results. A maximum difference of 5% is observed in the comparison between the simulated and measured ISF loading forces in the steady-state deformations. The comparisons demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method to characterize the plastic flow of metal.</p>
